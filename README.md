## ðŸ“„ \[PE-042\] Software Engineer Quiz

### Background:

For the sake of argument and certainly with a need to stretch your
imagination, assume that we work for Open Table rather than the largest
privately held, independent, and best mortgage origination company in metro
Denver.

Here at Denver's Open Tables, we've decided to display a very basic website
built in the following stack:

1. Back-end: Ruby on Rails running in API-only mode, which queries a seperate API maintained by a different team.
2. Front-end: [ReactJS][react] wrapped in the [Ionic][ionic] hybrid framework.
3. Database: PostgreSQL, but it's not currently utilized.
4. Javascript: It's actually [Typescript][typescript]!

As far as users are concerned, this website has the following features:

1. When the page loads, the database is queried and returns the current restaurant data in a table of restaurant names and addresses.
2. Restaurants with currently open tables are displayed on the page; there is no pagination because this application is primarily intended for mobile use.

Unfortunately, the team member who was working on building out this application had to take a leave of absence and left a few things unfinished:

1. While the logic required to query the other team's API is in place at `api/app/services/restaurants_service.rb`, the controller action needed to serve that data to the client app is currently just returning an empty array.
2. In the client application, our missing team member wrote the request logic to get data from the Rails backend managed by our team as well as a `TODO` item to actually retrieve the data when the page loads, but they weren't quite able to finish that up before leaving; it also looks like they didn't quite finish up the Typescript interface needed for a Restaurant object.
3. Similarly, they did add the logic to display the retrieved restaurant data in a table with columns for name and address, but they left this a bit unfinished as well.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. When the user loads the application, the restaurant data should populate the table and display the names and addresses of all restaurants in the response payload.
2. The data used by the frontend should be requested via a chain of 2 requests, React client -> Rails API -> ultimate backend API managed by another team.
